# OpenAI GPT Token Counter

![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/openai-gpt-token-counter)
![DT](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript%20Support-DT-blue)

This npm package is designed to count the number of OpenAI tokens in a given text or messages array. It supports various OpenAI text and chat models, and it has been verified for 100% accuracy.

## Installation

You can install the package using npm:

```bash
npm install openai-gpt-token-counter
```

## Usage

### Importing the Module

For CommonJS:

```javascript
const openaiTokenCounter = require('openai-gpt-token-counter');
```

For ES6 Imports:

```javascript
import openaiTokenCounter from 'openai-gpt-token-counter';
```

### Counting Tokens in Text

To count the number of tokens in a text for a specific OpenAI text model (e.g. text-davinci-003), use the `text` method:

```javascript
const text = "This is a test sentence.";
const model = "text-davinci-003"; // Replace with your desired OpenAI model

const tokenCount = openaiTokenCounter.text(text, model);
console.log(`Token count: ${tokenCount}`);
```

### Counting Tokens in Chat Messages

To count the number of tokens in chat messages for a specific OpenAI chat model, use the `chat` method:

```javascript
const messages = [
  { role: "user", content: "Say this is a test!" },
  // Add more messages if needed
];

const model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"; // Replace with your desired OpenAI chat model

const tokenCount = openaiTokenCounter.chat(messages, model);
console.log(`Token count: ${tokenCount}`);
```
### Example Messages Array for Chat Models

For chat models, provide an array of messages, where each message is an object with the following structure:

```javascript
const messages = [
  { role: "system", content: "System prompt to guide the AI" },
  { role: "user", content: "Message content from the user" },
  { role: "assistant", content: "AI response to the user's message" },
  // Add more messages as needed
];
```

The `role` property can be one of `"user"`, `"system"`, or `"assistant"`. The `content` property holds the actual text of the message.

## Supported Models

This package supports **all OpenAI chat/text models**, but the official ones we tested on are:

### Text Models

- GPT3 (text-davinci-003, text-curie-001, text-babbage-001, text-ada-001)

### Chat Models

- GPT3.5 Turbo: `"gpt-3.5-turbo"`
- GPT3.5 16K: `"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k"`
- GPT4: `"gpt-4"`
- GPT4 32K: `"gpt-4-32k"`

## Accuracy

This module has been tested and verified for 100% accuracy against the OpenAI API's token count. Here is an example test code:

```javascript
import openaiTokenCounter from 'openai-gpt-token-counter';
import { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from "openai";

const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);

(async () => {
  const model = "gpt-3.5-turbo";
  const texts = [
    "Hello world",
    "This is a slightly longer sentence with more words.",
    "And this is an even longer sentence that has an excessive number of words..."
  ];

  for (let text of texts) {
    console.log(`Testing text: "${text}"`);
    const messages = [{ role: "user", content: text }];

    const tokenCount = openaiTokenCounter.chat(messages, model);
    console.log(`openai-gpt-token-counter Token count: ${tokenCount}`);

    const chatCompletion = await openai.createChatCompletion({
      model: model,
      messages: messages,
    });
    console.log(`OpenAI API Token count: ${chatCompletion.data.usage.prompt_tokens}`);
    console.log("\n");
  }
})();
```

## Note on Embeddings

Please note that this package does not support embeddings. It is specifically designed for counting the number of tokens in text or chat messages for OpenAI models. Though this is on our roadmap, we do not have an ETA for when this feature will be added.
